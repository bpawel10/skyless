Proof of concept of an easily customizable MMORPG game engine.
### Getting started
1. Copy environment variables
```
cp .env.example .env
```
2. Start the engine
````
docker compose up
````
3. Connect using [OTClient](https://github.com/mehah/otclient) or any other compatible client. It was tested on client version 8.0, but should work for versions 7.8-8.22. You can use any login and password or just leave input fields empty.
